# ucsb-teaching-cs.github.io
A website for the UCSB Undergraduate Learning Assistant (ULA) Program.

This website is based on the Just the Class GitHub Pages template by Kevin Lin:
* https://github.com/kevinlin1/just-the-class
* https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse390ha/20au/

The main website page is the `index.md` in the main branch. 
Faculty bios are stored in the `_staffers` directory and photos are placed in the `assets/images`, and rendered according to the layout file, `_layouts/staffer.html`. 

The Resources are rendered from the information in the `_modules/all.md` file.
